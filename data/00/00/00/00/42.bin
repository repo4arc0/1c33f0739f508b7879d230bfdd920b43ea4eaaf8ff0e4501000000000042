你好  汉克
Hello, Hank.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,050
你应该在莫斯科
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,770
我绕了个道
I took a detour...

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,770
去了你的防御实验室
through your defense lab.

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,600
告诉我这不是我想的那个东西
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,240
那得看你是不是认为
That depends if you think

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,500
这是意图复制我实验成果的失败品
it's a poor attempt to replicate my work.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,630
就算是你们三个  这也太胆大了
Even for this group, that takes nerve.

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,130
你受命前往俄罗斯
You were instructed to go to Russia.

18
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,480
我需要提醒你  皮姆博士  你是名军人
May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you're a soldier...

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,420
我是个科学家
I'm a scientist.

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,170
那就有点科学家的样子
Then act like one.

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,210
皮姆粒子是从古至今
The Pym Particle is the

22
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,850
最具革命性的科学发明
most revolutionary science ever developed.

23
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,110
帮我们物尽其用
Help us put it to good use.

24
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,500
我让你们把我当仆人一样使唤
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,870
可你们现在居然试图盗取我的研究
and now you try to steal my research?

26
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,270
要是当时你也像现在这么猛地保护简妮特 皮姆博士
If only you'd protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,480
别冲动  汉克
Easy, Hank.

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,640
你再敢提我妻子试试
You mention my wife again

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,580
我就让你见识下什么叫猛
and I'll show you ferocity.

30
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,490
别看我  话是你说的
Don't look at me. You said it.

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,790
我正实提出辞职
I formally tender my resignation.

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,270
我们拒绝接受  正式的
We don't accept it. Formally.

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,410
汉克
Hank,

34
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,940
我们需要你
we need you.

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,870
皮姆粒子是个奇迹  拜托了
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

36
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,270
别让你的过去决定未来
Don't let your past determine the future.

37
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,920
只要我还活着
As long as I am alive,

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,670
谁都休想得到那个公式
nobody will ever get that formula.

39
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,480
我们不该让他离开这栋楼
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,370
你已经骗了他了
You've already lied to him.

41
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,690
现在还想跟他开战吗
Now you want to go to war with him?

42
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,670
是的
Yes.

43
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,710
我们的科学家想复制他的成果还差得远呢
Our scientists haven't come close to replicating his work.

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,610
他刚才已经着实地教训了你一顿
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,390
你真想体验下
You really want to find out

46
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,150
在你看都看不到他在哪时  他有多厉害吗
what it's like when you can't see him coming?

47
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,860
我认识汉克·皮姆很久了
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,420
他不是安全隐患
He's no security risk.

49
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,040
除非我们把他逼到那步
Unless we make him one.

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,410
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,191)}现在

放马过来吧
Come get you some now.

54
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,260
你连动都没动一下
You didn't even move.

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,640
是啊
Nah.

56
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,130
我要是打你左边呢  就下面这里
What if I come in on the left side, right? Just down here.

57
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,390
你看到这里了吗
You see this right here?

58
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,180
我会想你的  斯科特
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

59
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,780
我也会想你的  桃子
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

60
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,010
你们这帮人的道别仪式真怪
Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals.

61
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,410
好了  散了吧
All right, break it up.

62
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,090
散了吧  散了吧
Break it up! Break it up!

Hey, what's up with your eye?

69
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,050
你觉得呢
Oh. Well, what do you think?

Oh, yeah. I still got my scar from a year ago.

72

可你知道吗
You know what?

73
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,230
我仍然是唯一一个把他打趴下的人
I'm still the only one who knocked him out.

74
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,320
我可没做到
Well, I definitely didn't.

谢谢你来接我  哥们
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

我妈也死了
Yeah, my ma died, too.

Thanks for the hook-up, too. I needed a place to stay.

84

当你看到沙发再说吧
You wait till you see this couch.

85

你肯定会很高兴的
You're gonna be really happy.

86
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,840
你会很快站稳脚跟的  看着吧
You're gonna be on your feet in no time. Watch.

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,770
希望如此
I hope so.

88
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,740
我还要把你介绍给一些人
And I gotta introduce you to some people.

89

一些非常有才的人
Some really skilled people.

90

-没兴趣  -得了吧
- Not interested. - Yeah, right.

91
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,280
不  说真的  我不要再坐牢了
No, I'm serious, man. I'm not going back.

92
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,040
我还有个女儿要照顾
I got a daughter to take care of.

93
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,970
你知道有案底的人不好找工作吧
You know that jobs don't come easy for ex-cons, right?

94
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,210
哥们  我可是电气工程硕士好吧
Look, man, I got a master's in electrical engineering, all right?

109
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,660
戴尔

芭斯罗缤总会查出来的
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

115

我很抱歉  但是我
Look, I'm sorry, all right? But I...

116
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,700
没人肯雇我
No one would hire me.

117
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,180
非法闯入  重大盗窃罪
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

118
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,340
我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

119
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,090
我已经金盆洗手了  我只是
I don't do it anymore. I just...

120
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,130
向你致敬
Respect.

121

You really stuck it to those billionaire SOBs.

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,250
我对你做的那些事了解得越多
The more I read about what you did and stuff...

126
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,070
我越觉得"我居然认识这家伙
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?

127
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,850
他现在归我管"
I'm in charge of this guy?"

我这份工作做的很开心
Well, I'm very happy in this job,

我很感谢有机会可以
and I really just appreciate the opportunity to...

130
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,440
你当然是被炒了
Well, you're fired, of course.

131
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,010
我不能留着你
I can't really keep you on.

132
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,850
等一下  什么  炒了
Wait, what? Fired?

133
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,620
是的
Yeah.

134
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,110
戴尔  那不是暴力犯罪
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.

135
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,190
我是个好员工
I mean, I'm a good worker.

136
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,280
不  的确不是暴力犯罪  是酷炫型的
No, it wasn't a violent crime. It was a cool crime.

137
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,530
但我告诉你
I'll tell you what, though.

138
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,680
当然是私下的  不对外啊
This will be totally off the books, off the records,

139
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,720
如果你走的时候想拿上一杯
but if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts

00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,100
芒果水果风暴的话
on your way out the door,

141
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,920
我会假装没看到
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

142
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,410
斯科蒂  怎么了
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

143
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,800
我还以为你在上班呢
I thought you were supposed to be at work.

144
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,690
刚被炒了
I was. I got fired.

145
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,150
该死的  他们查出你是谁了
Damn. They find out who you are?

146
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,360
芭斯罗缤总能查出来  哥们
Baskin-Robbins always finds out, bro.

147
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,240
芭斯罗缤可不是玩的
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

148
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,700
要吃华夫饼吗
You want some waffles?

149
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,560
好  给我来一个
Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

150
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,040
那位是科特
Oh. That's Kurt.

151
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,970
他在福尔松蹲了五年  他是电脑天才
He was Folsom for five years. He's a wizard on that laptop.

152
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,780
很高兴认识你
Nice meet you.

153
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,150
我也很高兴认识你
Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

154
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,040
你是谁
Who are you?

155
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,500
戴夫
Dave.

156
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,610
维斯塔那票干的不错

维斯塔那票  没错
Vista job, yes.

158
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,130
不  不  我听说过这个打劫
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

159
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,640
严格来讲  我没有打劫他们  打劫包括恐吓
Well, technically, I didn't rob them. Robbery involves threat.

160
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,320
我讨厌暴力  我偷了他们  我是个飞贼
I hate violence. I burgled them. I'm a cat burglar.

161
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,660
你是说你是个怂货
You mean you're a pussy.

162
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,060
他们对顾客漫天要价
They were overcharging the customers, right?

163
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,650
总计得有上百万
And it added up to millions.

164
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,620
他揭发了这件事结果被炒了
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

165
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,950
他接下来做了什么
And what does he do?

166
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,350
他黑进了安保系统
He hacks into the security system

167
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,310
把上百万美金
and transfers millions

168
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,980
转回给了那些被骗的人账上
back to the people that they stole it from.

169
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,060
还把所有的银行记录都放到了网上
Posts all the bank records online.

170
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,380
还把那家伙的宾利开进了他家泳池里
And he drove the dude's Bentley into his swimming pool.

171
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,970
你这是在干吗
What are you doing?

172
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,830
为什么把我的人生故事告诉这俩人
Why are you telling my life story to these guys?

173
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
你想干吗
What do you want?

174
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,500
好吧
Okay.

175
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,800
我表兄两周前跟一个人
My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago

176
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,320
聊到一票超完美的活
about this little perfect job.

177
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,250
不干
No way.

178
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,720
别别别  等一下  这个人
No, no, no. Wait! This guy...

179
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
正好是你不喜欢的那种
This guy fits your M.O.

180
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,470
不要
No!

181
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,030
我金盆洗手了  我不要再进监狱了
I'm finished, man. I'm not going back to jail.

182
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,310
是个拿着丰厚养老金退休的百万富翁
It's some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute.

183
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,390
这简直就是斯科特·朗的完美目标
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

184
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,290
我不在乎  我不干
I don't care. I'm out.

185
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,350
皮姆博士
Dr. Pym?

186
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,850
是的  我还活着
Yes. I'm still alive.

187
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,180
身份证明
ID?

188
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,150
有那个就够了吧
Perhaps that will suffice.

189
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,370
很抱歉  先生  请进
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

190

那是汉克·皮姆吗
Is that Hank Pym?

191
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,250
早上好  汉克
Good morning, Hank.

192
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,840
霍普
Hope.

193
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,110
叫我一声爸会死吗
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

194
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,590
你能抽空来见我们
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that

195
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,580
克洛斯博士会很开心的
you could find the time to join us today.

196
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,660
简直是激动万分
More like "thrilled".

197
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,640
收到你发的邀请函
I was surprised to receive

198
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,260
我还真是意外呀  达伦
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

199
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,770
今天是什么大日子
What's the occasion?

200
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,250
你会知道的  对吧  霍普
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

201
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,640
里面已经准备好了  就等你了
We're ready for you inside.

202
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,900
还是不理你呀
Ouch.

203
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,700
看来有些旧伤是无法痊愈的
I guess some old wounds never heal, huh?

204
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,330
别担心  我会照顾好她的
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

205
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,730
你这次是来看好戏的
You're in for a treat.

206
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,750
好久不见  皮姆博士  退休生活还好吗
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym. How's retirement?

207
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,540
你的脸还好吗
How's your face?

208
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,130
你先请
After you.

209
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,170
在我们开始前
Now, before we start,

210
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,800
我想先介绍一位非常特别的嘉宾
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

211
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,790
这个公司的创始人以及我的导师
This company's founder and my mentor,

212
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,250
汉克·皮姆博士
Dr. Hank Pym.

213
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,350
当我从皮姆博士手中接管了这家公司时
When I took over this company for Dr. Pym,

214
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,630
我便立刻开始研究一个
I immediately started researching a particle

215
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,560
可以改变分子间距离
that could change the distance between atoms,

216
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,780
并增加密度和力量的粒子
while increasing density and strength.

217
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,820
如此一个革命性的想法为何会
Why this revolutionary idea remained buried

218
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,740
一直被埋在汉克的众多研究中
beneath the dust and cobwebs of

219
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,660
积累尘土和蜘蛛网  我不得而知
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

220
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,660
但请想像一下
But just imagine,

221
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,380
一个昆虫大小的士兵
a soldier the size of an insect.

222
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,090
终极秘密武器
The ultimate secret weapon.

223
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,710
蚁人
An Ant-Man.

224
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,470
他们当初就是这么称呼你的  对吧  汉克
That's what they called you. Right, Hank?

225
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,510
有点傻  我知道
Silly, I know.

226
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,030
这只是宣传手段
Propaganda.

227
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,640
用来唬人的故事
Tales to astonish!

228
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,950
捏造出来吓唬苏联的故事
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

229
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,970
汉克  可以请你告诉来宾们
Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me

230
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,470
我每一次问你"蚁人真实存在吗"
every single time I asked you,

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,760
你是怎么回答我的
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

232
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,360
这只是个传说
Just a tall tale.

233
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,200
没错
Right.

234
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,140
因为如此不可思议的事
Because how could anything so miraculous

235
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,690
怎么可能是真的
possibly be real?

236
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,680
我受到蚁人传说的启发
Well, I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man.

237
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,490
有了我缩小无机物材料的突破性进展
And with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material,

238
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,180
我就想  有没有可能把人也缩小呢
I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person?

239
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,840
这有可能做到吗
Could that be done?

240
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,010
这不再是个传说了
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

241
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,170
尊敬的来宾们
Distinguished guests,

242
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,360
我自豪地向你们展示现代战争的终结者
I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it.

243
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,200
黄衫
The Yellowjacket!

244
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,250
不
Oh, no.

245
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,120
黄衫是全能的战争武器
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war

246
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,850
它可以改变穿着者的大小

247
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,240
能够轻松打赢战争
for the ultimate combat advantage.

248
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,130
在我们现今生活的时代
We live in an era

249
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,530
我们用来保护自己的武器

250
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,270
受到持续监视的削弱

251
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,890
来回到简单的时代
It's time to return to a simpler age.

252
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,520
让人们可以公开地
One where the powers of freedom

253
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,290
使用自由的权利
can once again operate openly

254
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,190
来保卫自己的利益
to protect their interests.

255
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,640
一个全能型维和的机甲
An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,

256
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,000
黄衫可以悄无声息地
the Yellowjacket can manage any conflict

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,950
解决地缘政治中的

258
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,880
任何冲突
completely unseen.

259
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,980
在预防手段和战术袭击中

260
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,670
均有奇效

261
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,260
实际应用包括监视
Practical applications include surveillance,

262
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,900
工业破坏
industrial sabotage,

263
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,650
和清除和平道路上的一切障碍
and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace.

264
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,450
只需一件黄衫
A single Yellowjacket

265
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,600
使用者即可享有执行保护措施的

266
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,930
无限能力
to carry out protective actions.

267
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,940
在不久后的一天  一支穿着黄衫的军队
And, one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets

268
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,140
将在全球范围创造一个

270
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,910
黄衫
The Yellowjacket.

271
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,050
所以这就是件衣服
So, it's a suit?

272
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,480
别说这么粗俗  弗兰克
Don't be crude, Frank.

273
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,410
这不是件衣服  而是个机甲
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

274
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,730
怎么了  这项发明没有打动你吗
What's the matter? You're not impressed?

275
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,860
不  让人印象深刻  但我也有顾虑
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

276
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,450
想像一下我们的敌人能用这项技术做什么
Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.

277
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,190
我们应该好好聊一下这个问题  弗兰克
We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank.

278
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,750
我很重视你的意见
I really value your opinion.

279
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,790
谢谢大家莅临  霍普
Thank you for coming. Hope?

280
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,060
非常感谢诸位  我现在将带大家离场
Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now.

281
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,060
谢谢
Thank you.

282
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,140
你好像有点震惊
You seem a bit shocked.

283
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,670
达伦  我尘封那些秘密是有原因的
Darren, there's a reason that I buried these secrets.

284
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,380
你终于承认了
So you finally admit it!

285
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,420
我们本可携手完成  汉克
We could have done this together, Hank.

286
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,870
但你却把机会毁了
But you ruined that.

287
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,350
所以你只停留在过去  我才是未来
That's why you're the past and I'm the future.

288
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,100
别这么做
Don't do this.

289
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,320
克洛斯博士
Dr. Cross?

290
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,970
你先卖给我  我出比你要价高20%的价格
You sell to me first, 20% over your asking price,

291
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,070
两周后我就可以付你现金
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

292
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,000
成交
Deal.

293
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,230
我们该行动了  汉克
We have to make our move, Hank.

294
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,880
他进展得怎么样了
How close is he?

295
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,030
他还没法缩小生物
He still can't shrink a live subject.

296
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,890
你就把衣服给我
Just give me the suit

297
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,770
我来永除后患
and let me finish this once and for all.

298
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,720
不行
No.

299
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,780
克洛斯完全信任我
I have Cross' complete trust.

300
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,660
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

301
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,460
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

302
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,660
也不尽然
Well, that's not entirely true.

303
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,240
我想我找到了合适的人选
I think I found a guy.

304
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,090
谁
Who?

305
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,960
爸爸
Daddy!

306
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,760
小花生
Peanut! Oh!

307
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,240
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

308
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,100
非常抱歉  我迟到了
I'm so sorry I'm late.

309
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,840
我不知道聚会几点开始
I didn't know what time your party started.

310
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,560
邀请上写了时间的
It was on the invitation.

311
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,320
他都没收到邀请
He didn't get an invitation.

312
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,850
可他还是来了
But he came anyway!

313
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,980
我不会错过宝贝女儿的生日聚会
Well, I'm not gonna miss my little girl's birthday party.

314
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,650
我去告诉妈妈你来了
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

315
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,590
别
Oh, you don't...

316
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,910
你来这儿干什么  郎
What are you doing here, Lang?

317
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,370
你没给过孩子一分钱的抚养费
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

318
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,200
现在  只要我乐意  就可以逮捕你
You know, right now, if I wanted to, I could arrest you.

319
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,450
好像我很愿意见你似的  帕克斯顿
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

320
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,910
你能来妈妈可高兴了  她喝水都呛着了
Mommy's so happy you're here, she choked on her drink.

321
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,440
看我给你带了什么
Hey, look what I have for you.

322
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,400
我能现在就打开吗
Can I open it now?

323
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,130
当然能  宝贝儿  今天是你的生日啊
Of course, sweetheart. It's your birthday.

324
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,550
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend.

325
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,570
那是什么玩意儿
What is that thing?

326
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,560
他好丑啊
He's so ugly!

327
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,460
我爱死他了
I love him!

328
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,570
我能拿给我朋友们看吗
Can I go show my friends?

329
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,520
当然能  宝贝儿  去吧
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

330
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,930
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend.

331
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,970
我会给孩子抚养费的
Look, the child support is coming, all right?

332
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,710
不过有了前科就很难找到工作
It's just hard finding a job when you have a record.

333
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,780
我相信你能想法解决
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

334
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,300
不过现在
But for now,

335
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,660
-我希望你离开我家  -不可能
- I want you out of my house. - No way!

336
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,600
这是我女儿的生日聚会
It's my daughter's birthday party.

337
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,880
-这是我家  -那又如何
- It's my house! - So what?

338
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,140
-她是我闺女  -斯科特
- It's my kid! - Scott!

339
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,530
你不能说来就来  你知道的  走吧
You can't just show up here. You know that. Come on.

340
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,550
这是生日聚会啊
It's a birthday party.

341
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,510
我知道  但你不能说来就来
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

342
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,310
她是我闺女
She's my daughter.

343
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,930
你根本就不懂怎么做父亲
You don't know the first thing about being a father.

344
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,500
玛姬  看在你是我初恋
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,

345
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,220
我们还是朋友的份上  我告诉你
and as the first love of my life.

346
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,010
你的未婚夫是个混袋
Your fiance is an asshat.

347
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,860
他不是混袋
He's not an asshat.

348
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,080
喂  嘴巴放干净点儿
Hey, watch your language. Okay?

349
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,130
哪里不干净了  我说的是袋
What language? I said "Hat."

350
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,140
别吵了
Stop it.

351
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,000
真的吗  玛姬  就他
Really, Maggie? That guy?

352
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,570
你可以嫁给任何你喜欢的人
Come on! You could marry anyone you want,

353
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,250
为什么偏要选个条子呢
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

354
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,810
至少他不是骗子
At least he's not a crook.

355
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,460
我在努力  我已经改过自新  洗手不干了
I'm trying, okay? I've changed. I'm straight.

356
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,850
我找了份工作
I had a job and...

357
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,250
我想付抚养费
I wanna provide.

358
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,160
我花了很多时间思考  现在我明白了
I had a lot of time to think about it and I love her.

359
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,900
我非常爱她
So much.

360
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,200
我错过了太多
I've missed so much time

361
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,830
我想成为她生活的一部分
and I wanna be a part of her life.

362
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,060
我该怎么做
What do I do?

363
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,590
租套公寓
Get an apartment,

364
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,730
找份工作  付抚养费
get a job, pay child support.

365
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,700
然后我们再讨论探视孩子的问题
And then we will talk about visitation, I promise.

366
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,960
你是她的英雄  斯科特
You're her hero, Scott.

367
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,640
成为她心目中的那个人吧
Just be the person that she already thinks you are.

368
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,010
弗兰克  很遗憾
I'm sorry you have such

369
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,340
你对黄衫深表担忧
deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

370
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,490
是啊
Yeah. Well, uh...

371
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,010
很不幸  我们不能为所欲为
Unfortunately, we can't just do whatever we want.

372
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,710
那样就好了
It'd be nice though, right?

373
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,610
但是得遵守法则
But there are laws.

374
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,170
什么法则  人的吗
What laws? Of man?

375
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,840
自然法则高于人的法则
The laws of nature transcend the laws of man.

376
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,950
而我要高于自然法则
And I have transcended the laws of nature.

377
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,240
达伦  我觉得你不懂
Darren, I don't think you understand...

378
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,580
我们还没解决所有问题
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

379
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,280
永别了  弗兰克
Goodbye, Frank.

380
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,150
谢谢
Thank you.

381
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,270
我最近一直在想感恩这事
You know, I've been thinking a lot about gratitude lately.

382
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,860
今天早上  我在冥想的时候
And today, during my morning meditation,

383
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,400
得出了一个有意思的结论
an interesting thought occurred to me,

384
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,130
我觉得也适用于你
and I think it might apply to you, too.

385
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,000
什么结论
How's that?

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,910
感恩可以是原谅
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

387
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,080
我有好几年都活在对汉克·皮姆的愤恨中
I've spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym.

388
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,720
我把我的才华都奉献给了他
I devoted my genius to him.

389
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,480
我本来可以去任何地方工作
I could have worked anywhere.

390
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,110
我没选好导师
I chose my mentor poorly.

391
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,610
而你甚至别无选择
You didn't even have a choice.

392
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,900
他根本就不相信你
He never believed in you.

393
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,330
之前赶你走真是不好
It's a shame what we had to do,

394
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,480
可这都是被他逼的  对不对
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

395
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,340
但我们不该生气  我们应该感恩
But we shouldn't be angry, we should be grateful.

396
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,050
因为作为失败的导师
Because his failures as a mentor,

397
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,850
失败的父亲
as a father,

398
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,440
是他逼我们一展鸿图
forced us to spread our wings.

399
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,390
达伦  你成功了
You're a success, Darren.

400
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,180
你能获得的一切都当之无愧
You deserve everything coming your way.

401
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,830
{\an8}{\pos(194,154)} 再过377天才能见到凯西

402
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,750
别作弊了
Stop cheating.

403
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,200
回来啦  能人
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

404
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,360
他可能没听见你说话
Maybe he didn't hear you.

405
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,160
生日聚会怎么样
How was the party?

406
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,950
跟我说说那个活
Tell me about that tip.

407
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,070
什么
What?

408
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,290
我想知道你说的那个活
I wanna know about that tip.

409
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,820
宝贝儿  开工了  现在就行动
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

410
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,520
别激动  我就想知道消息的来源
Calm down, all right? I just need to know where it came from.

411
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,020
要绝对可靠才行
It's gotta be airtight.

412
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,400
好
Okay.

413
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,060
我和表兄欧内斯托一起参加一场品酒会
I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto.

414
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,050
当时大部分是红酒
Which was mainly reds,

415
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,380
你知道我不喜欢红酒
and you know I don't like reds, man.

416
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,570
但有种玫瑰葡萄酒扭转了局面
But there was a rose that saved the day.

417
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,610
那天我们很愉快
It was delightful.

418
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,960
他跟我聊起一个姑娘
And then he tells me about this girl,

419
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,440
艾米丽  她以前经常跟我们鬼混
Emily, that we used to kick it with.

420
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,710
其实那是我摸过的第一对奶
It was actually the first pair of boobs I ever touched.

421
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,570
你扯远了
It's the wrong details.

422
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,210
这跟你要讲的事毫无瓜葛
It has nothing to do with the story.

423
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,190
重讲
Go.

424
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,800
他告诉我她现在有份工作
So, uh, he tells me that she's

425
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,610
是帮别人打扫卫生
working as a housekeeper now, right?

426
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,980
她在跟一个叫卡洛斯的家伙约会
And she's dating this dude, Carlos,

427
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,940
他是海湾那头的一个大佬
who's a shot caller from across the bay.

428
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,140
她把她雇主的情况告诉了他
And she tells him about the dude that she's cleaning for.

429
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,600
他雇主是个很牛的执行总裁
Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO

430
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,750
已经金盆洗手  但是超级有钱

431
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,700
卡洛斯和欧内斯托在同一个垒球队
And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team,

432
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,250
他们有天开始聊天
and they get to talking, right?

433
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,870
好戏来了  卡洛斯说  "伙计
And here comes the good part. Carlos says, "Yo, man.

434
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,700
"有个人有个超大的保险柜
"This guy's got a big-ass safe just

435
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,920
"就放在地下室  就放在那"
"Sitting in the basement, just chilling."

436
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,960
欧内斯托当然就来找了我
Of course Ernesto comes to me because

437
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,020
因为他知道我盗窃技能了得
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

438
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,330
当然  我问了他
Of course, I ask him...

439
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,120
艾米丽告诉卡洛斯告诉你
"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you

440
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,830
告诉我那是个什么样的保险柜了吗
"To get to me what kind of safe it was?"

441
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,280
他说  没有
And he says, "Nah, dawg.

442
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,540
她只说保险柜超赞
"All she said is that it's super-legit

443
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,930
装在里面的肯定是好东西
"And whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."

444
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,830
什么
What?

445

447
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,720
好吧  有个老头  他有个保险柜
All right. There's an old man, he's got a safe,

448
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,800
而且有一周不在家
and he's gone for a week.

449
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,040
就按这个来计划
Let's just work with that.

450
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,240
我说什么来着
You know what I'm saying?

451
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,270
座机线剪了  手机信号阻断
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

452
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,740

00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,460
要是出了状况  还有我呢
Hey, if the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?

456
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,470
别担心
Don't worry.

457
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,960
不会出状况的
It's not gonna happen.

458
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,030
我就喜欢他自负的样子
I love it when he gets cocky.

459
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,220

并不会
Not necessarily.

怎么了
What is it?

472
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,270
他们没开玩笑  这个保险柜相当保险
Well, they weren't kidding. This safe is serious.

473
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,450

你能打开吗

479
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,210
关键在于  这种钢不怎么耐寒
Well, here's the thing. It doesn't do so well in the cold.

I know you needed to score.

我以为我们是用老鼠
I thought we were using mice.

502
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,880
有区别吗
What's the difference?

00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,480
开始实验34-C  有机物原子缩小实验

512
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,440
斯科蒂  在吗
Scotty, what's up, man?

不知道这是什么呢
I wonder... What is this?

514
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,410
从这下面看上去
The world sure seems different

515
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,450
世界还真不一样  是不是  斯科特

路易斯  我在下面

518
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,560

It's a trial by fire, Scott. Or, in this case,

519
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,990
或者现在是放水
water.

520
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,020
你比自己想象的要坚强
Guess you're tougher than you thought.

521
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,750
我不想看这个

我们都快相信
You know, you almost had us convinced

535
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,220
你真的改过自新了

她们都很看好你
They were really rooting for you.

537
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,030
这会伤透她们的心
It's gonna break their hearts.

538
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
你有访客
You got a visitor.

你的律师
Your lawyer.

541
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,750
我的律师
My lawyer?

542
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,200
我说过我会联系你的  斯科特
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

543
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,570
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

544
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,230
你更愿意待在牢房里了
that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

545
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,310
天哪

坐下
Sit down.

547
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,130
先生  对不起  我偷了衣服

548
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,110
我根本不想知道你为什么有这个
I don't even wanna know why you have it.

549
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,910

How do you know about...

551
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,640
怪不得她不让你接近凯西
No wonder she's trying to keep you away from Cassie.

552
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,950
世事开始变艰难的时候
The moment things get hard,

553
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,600
你就会回去犯罪
you turn right back to crime.

554
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,750
在我看来  你有一个选择
The way I see it, you have a choice.

555
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,890
要么在监狱里度过余生
You can either spend the rest of your life in prison,

556
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,180
要么回到你的牢房
or go back to your cell

557
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,140
等待进一步的指示
and await further instructions.

558
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,160
我不明白
I don't understand.

559
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,930
我也不指望你能明白
No, I don't expect you to.

560
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,100
但你现在没什么选择的余地
But you don't have many options right now,

561
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,560
坦白讲  我也没有
and quite frankly, neither do I.

562
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,630
你觉得当初
Why do you think

563
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,640
我为什么要让你偷那套衣服呢
I let you steal that suit in the first place?

564
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,710
什么
What?

565
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,300
第二次机会可是很难得啊
Second chances don't come around all that much.

566
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,440
所以下次你要是觉得看到了机会
So, next time you think you might see one,

567
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,840
我建议你仔细看看
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

568
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,030
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend!

569
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,430
你真的不想要别的玩具吗
Are you sure you don't want a different toy?

570
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,200
不  我喜欢这个
No, I love this one.

571
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,030
好吧  睡觉吧  我爱你
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

572
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,220
妈妈
Mommy?

573
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,670
爸爸是坏人吗
Is Daddy a bad man?

574
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,950
我听有些大人说他是坏人
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

575
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,360
不是
No.

576
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,460
爸爸有时只是有些迷茫
Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?

577
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,210
明智之选  你总算听进去了一回
Smart choice. You actually listened, for once.

578
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,170
从门下走
Under the door.

579
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,710
好吧  现在去哪里
Okay, where to now?

580
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,140
-稳住 -天呐
- Hang tight. - Oh, God.

581
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,640
什么  什么
What, what?

582
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,680
他跑哪儿去了
Where the hell did he go?

583
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,070
我不知道  他就那么消失了
I have no idea. He just vanished.

584
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,010
封锁周边五个街区  马上
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

585
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,420
退后  退后  退后
Get back! Get back! Get back!

586
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,300
-斯科特  这些是我的同伴  -什么
- Scott, these are my associates.  - What?

587
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,310
那只蚂蚁身上是背了个相机吗
Is that a camera on an ant?

588
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,690
是啊  当然了  为什么不呢
Yeah, sure. Why not?

589
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,000
车在哪
Where's the car?

590
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,660
没有车  我们用飞的
No car. We've got wings.

591
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,680
到达
Incoming!

592
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,720
把脚放在中心节点上  然后扶住胸腔
Put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax.

593
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,260
你在逗我吗
Are you Kidding?

594
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,760
-这东西安不安...  -你他妈快上去  斯科特
- How safe is... - Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

595
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,650
我为什么在一辆警车上
Why am I on a police car?

596
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,540
我难道不是不应该在警车上吗
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

597
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,590
这样你就可以搭个顺风车
So they can give you a lift

598
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,450
通过他们五个街区的封锁
past their five-block perimeter.

599
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,950
好吧  下一步怎么办
All right. Now, what's the next move?

600
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,140
抓紧了
Hang on tight.

601
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,950
这个容易  我找到窍门了
Oh, this is easy! I'm getting the hang of this.

602
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,600
往上拉就能向上飞  就像骑马一样
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

603
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,550
你要让247失去平衡了
You're throwing 247 off balance.

604
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,020
等等  他的名字叫247吗
Wait, his name is 247?

605
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,970
他没有名字  只有编号  斯科特
He doesn't have a name, he has a number, Scott.

606
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,700
你知道一共有多少只蚂蚁吗
Do you have any idea how many ants there are?

607
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,170
也许它是...也许它是248
Maybe it's... maybe it's 248.

608
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,810
不不不不  要晕了  要晕了
No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

609
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,850
不  我觉得它是247
No, I think it's 247.

610
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,350
等等
Wait.

611
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,810
抓紧了
Hang on tight!

612
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,720
我觉得我逐渐掌握窍门了
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

613
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,860
是我在控制247  他并非听命于你
I am controlling 247. He is not listening to you.

614
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,840
什么
What?

615
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,920
-我能提个小小的要求吗  -不能
- Can I make one little request? - No.

616
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,230
停下来  247  打住  打住
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

617
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,170
不玩了
Time out.

618
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,050
{\an8}斯科维亚事件该怪谁

619
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,710
好了  等一下
All right, hold on.

620
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,280
等等
Just wait!

621
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,940
假如我吐在了头盔里会发生什么
What happens if I throw up in this helmet?

622
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,070
这是我的头盔  斯科特  别吐里面
It's my helmet, Scott. You do not throw up.

623
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,620
让她停下来吧  好不好
Let's set her down, all right?

624
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,780
我头有点晕了
I'm getting light-headed.

625
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,030
坚持住  斯科特
Hang on, Scott.

626
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,310
我有点...
I'm getting a little...

627
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,950
不能睡过头
I need a snooze button.

628
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,050
5分钟后叫醒我
Hit me in 5 minutes.

629
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,070
你好
Hello.

630
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,840
你是谁
Who are you?

631

你就一直在那站着
Have you been standing there,

632
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,160
看我睡觉吗
watching me sleep, this whole time?

633
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,220
没错
Yes.

634
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,400
为什么
Why?

635
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,590
因为你上次来时  是来偷东西的
Because the last time you were here, you stole something.

636
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,070

我不在时就由它们在这盯着你
They're here to keep an eye on you when I can't.

642
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,120
皮姆博士在楼下等着你呢

Who?

这是谁的睡衣
Whose pajamas are these?

645
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,540
这要怎么走过去啊
How am I supposed to do this?

646
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,420
好吧  一步一步来
All right, just one step at a time.

647
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:20,180
你们不咬我  我就不踩你们  成交吗
You don't bite me, I don't step on you. Deal?

648
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,960
我可以破坏掉服务器
I could take down the servers

649

克洛斯不会发现的
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

650
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,790
我们不需要这个人
We don't need this guy.

651
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,430
我猜你已经见过我女儿霍普了
I assume that you've already met my daughter, Hope.

652
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,590
见过了  她真好
I did. She's great.

她不认为我们需要你
She doesn't think that we need you.

00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,860
我们是不需要  我们自己就能搞定
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

655
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,770

I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit,

656
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,550
然后霍普就害你被捕了
and then Hope has you arrested.

657
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,590
好吧  我们可以试试
Okay, we can try this

和这次的活儿有关
It has to do with this job,

我很佩服
I was very impressed with

你通过我的安保系统的方式

冰冻金属那招尤其聪明

Right. But how do you make them do that?

686

00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,180
你是说  她是谁  这他妈发生什么事了
Who are you, who is she, what the hell's going on,

697
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,830
我现在能回监狱吗
and can I go back to jail now?

698
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,280
和我来
Come with me.

699
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,010
40年前  我创造了一个公式
40 years ago, I created a formula

700
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,380
能改变原子间的相对距离
that altered atomic relative distance.

701
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,170
什么
Huh?

702
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,080
我得知了如何改变原子间的距离
I learned how to change the distance between atoms.

703
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,710
那就是那件衣服的动力
That's what powers the suit.

704
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,250
它运作的原理
That's why it works.

705
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,960
但这是很危险的
But it was dangerous.

706
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,040
过于危险了
It was too dangerous.

707
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,310
所以我将它藏起来了
So I hid it from the world.

708
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,990
从那时我便另起炉灶  开了自己的公司
And that's when I switched gears and I started my own company.

709
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,390
皮姆科技
Pym Tech.

710
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,270
没错
Yes.

711
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,090
我收了个年轻的学徒  名叫达伦·克洛斯
I took on a young protege called Darren Cross.

712
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,580
达伦·克洛斯
Darren Cross.

713
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,770
他可是个大人物啊
He's a big deal.

714
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,410
但在他成为大人物之前  他是我的助手
But before he was a big deal, he was my assistant.

715
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,370
我觉得自己看中了他的某些特质
I thought I saw something in him.

716
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,420
甚至把他当自己儿子了吧
The son I never had, perhaps.

717
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,030
他很有才华  但当我们关系越来越近时
He was brilliant, but as we became close,

718
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,370
他开始怀疑我有事没告诉他
he began to suspect that I wasn't telling him everything.

719
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,740
他听到了关于皮姆微粒的传言
He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particle,

720
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,790
从此开始着了魔般地想重现我的公式
and he became obsessed with recreating my formula.

721
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,360
但我不愿意帮他
But I wouldn't help him.

722
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,860
所以他背叛了我
So he conspired against me

723
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,480
投票把我赶出了我自己的公司
and he voted me out of my own company.

724
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,830
他是怎么做到的
How could he do that?

725
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,810
董事会的主席是我的女儿  霍普
The board's chairman is my daughter, Hope.

726
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,510
她投了决定性的一票
She was the deciding vote.

727
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,350
但当她看到克洛斯差不多就要
But she came back to me

728
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:48,350
重现我的公式时  她回到了我身边
when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula.

729
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,560
这整个过程非常的不稳定
The process is highly volatile.

730
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,760
假如没戴着特制的头盔
If one isn't protected by a specialized helmet,

731
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,840
有可能会影响到大脑的作用
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

732
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,880
我不认为达伦知道这一点
I don't think Darren realizes this,

733
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,210
再说了  他自己也没有多稳定
and, you know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.

734
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,090
所以  你想要我做什么
So, what do you want from me?

735
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,100
斯科特  我相信人人都该有赎罪的机会
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

736
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,070
你相信吗
Do you?

737
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,210
相信
I do.

738
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,610
假如你能帮我的话
If you can help me,

739
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,470
我保证能帮你重新回到你女儿身边
I promise I can help you be with your daughter again.

740
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,950
现在  你准备好自我救赎了吗
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

741
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,550
百分百好了
Absolutely.

742
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,190
我那些入室盗窃的日子一去不复返了
My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done.

743
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,810
您要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

744
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,430
我要你入室并且盗窃
I want you to break into a place and steal some shit.

745
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,300

你是在试图找到我爸爸吗
Are you trying to find my daddy?

是的  甜心
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

试图染指能改变世界格局的武器了

756
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:53,610
那是米切尔·卡森  神盾局前任防御部长
That's Mitchell Carson, Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

757
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:56,660
如今正赶着颠覆政府的勾当

他一直想要我的技术
He always wanted my tech.

759

除非我们能闯进去偷了黄衫
And now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket

并且毁掉所有数据

Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.

762
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,850
我觉得首先我们应该去向复仇者们求助
I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.

763
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,020
我花了大半辈子
I spent half my life

764

努力不让这项科技落入斯塔克手中
trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark.

00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,640

I'm sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now.

766
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,180
这可不是钢铁侠战衣那种小儿科
This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit.

斯科特  它们只是蚂蚁

蚂蚁  它们能做很多事

我比任何人都了解这项任务
I know this mission better than anybody here.

不然的话  这项任务没办法成功的

And now she looks at me and there's just disappointment.

the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic.

818
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,200
衣服有力量  人则是利用那种力量
The suit has power. The man harnesses that power.

819
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,120
你需要变得灵巧  敏捷  最重要的是
You need to be skillful, agile, and above all,

00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,560
你得要快
you need to be fast.

00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,840
你要能够在极短的时间内缩小
You should be able to shrink and grow

822
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:38,900
和变大
on a dime.

823
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,420
让你的体型总能配合你的行动
So your size always suits your needs.

824
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,230
现在  穿过那个钥匙孔  斯科特
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

825
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,600
你起跑时是大的
You charge big,

826
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,690
然后变小穿过
you dive small,

827
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,300
之后再变大
then you emerge big.

828
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,050
废物
Useless.

829
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,570
当你变小时  力量就被压缩了
When you're small, energy's compressed,

830
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,400
所以你180斤的男性的力量
so you have the force of a 200-pound man

你就像是一颗子弹

833
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,600
你出拳太重了  会把人杀死

834
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,500

848
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,970
你能不能别再重复那个谎言了
Could you please stop telling me that lie?

我们在干正事呢

别乱动那个调节器

假如那个调节器坏了

你会变成亚原子级

意思是你会进入一个量子界

become irrelevant

862
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,790
因为你会不断缩小

863
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,390
你所知和所爱的一切

你知道他让你冒了多大的风险

你有个女儿

934

936
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,040
他肯定很伤心
He was in grief.

937
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,580
我也是  我当时才七岁
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

938
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,180
然后他再也没回来  没有真正回来
And he never came back. Not in any way that counted.

939
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,890
他直接把我送到寄宿学校
He just sent me off to boarding school.

940
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,710
要知道  我以为
You know, I thought,

941
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,700
这次危机
with all that's at stake,

942
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,670
可能是我们重归于好的机会
just maybe we might have a chance of making peace.

943
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,120
可事到如今他还是对我拒之千里
But, even now, he still wants to shut me out.

944
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,800
他不是想拒绝你  他信任你
He doesn't wanna shut you out. He trusts you.

945
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,260
那要你来干什么
Then why are you here?

946
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,170
来证明他爱你
It proves that he loves you.

947
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,150
霍普  看着我
Hope. Look at me.

948
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:10,710
我是来当炮灰的
I'm expendable.

949
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:12,860
找我就是为了这个
That's why I'm here.

950
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,150
你现在应该也意识到了
You must have realized that by now.

951
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:19,150
这就是为什么是我穿那套衣服而不是你
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit and you're not.

952
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,240
他宁愿全盘皆输也不愿意失去你
He would rather lose this fight than lose you.

953
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:26,260
所以说
Anyway...

954
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,400
我打电话报警的时候
You know, I didn't know you had a daughter

955
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,230
不知道你有个女儿
when I called the cops on you.

956
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,180
她叫什么
What's her name?

957

很美的名字

959
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,690
你得整理思绪  斯科特

960
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,400
想法一定要明确
You have to make your thoughts precise.

961
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,680
这就是其中原理
That's how it works.

962
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,030
想想凯西
Think about Cassie.

963
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:57,460
想想你有多想见她  靠这个集中精力

睁开眼睛
Open your eyes

965
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,300
想想你想要蚂蚁们怎么做
and just think about what you want the ants to do.

966
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,690
做得好
That's good!

967
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,510
你母亲说服我
Your mother convinced me

968
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,670
让她也加入我的任务
to let her join me on my missions.

969
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,640
他们叫她黄蜂女
They called her the Wasp.

970
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,750
她手到擒来
She was born to it.

971
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:08,140
之后没有哪一天
And there's not a day that goes by

972
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,590
我不在后悔当初答应了她
that I don't regret having said yes.

973
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,670
那是1987年
It was 1987.

974
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,940
分裂派在苏联库斯科劫持了一个导弹发射井
Separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

975
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,520
并向美国发射了一枚洲际导弹
and launched an ICBM at the United States.

976
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,510
进入导弹内部的唯一方式
The only way to the internal mechanics

977
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,260
就是穿过固态钛
was through solid titanium.

978
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,620
我知道我得缩小到
I knew I had to shrink

979
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,860
比分子还小  才能解除导弹
between the molecules to disarm the missile.

980
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,820
但我的调节器受损太重
But my regulator had sustained too much damage.

981
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,170
你母亲
Your mother,

982
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,190
没有丝毫犹豫
she didn't hesitate.

983
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,620
简妮特  不要
Janet! No!

984
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,520
她关掉了她的调节器
She turned off her regulator

985
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,740
缩小到亚原子级
and went subatomic

986
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,030
解除了炸弹
to deactivate the bomb.

987
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,180
她牺牲了
And she was gone.

988
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,130
你妈妈是个英雄
Your mom died a hero.

989
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,930
接下来的十年时间
And I spent the next 10 years

990
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:40,690
我试图了解量子领域的一切
trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.

991
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,080
你想把她找回来
You were trying to bring her back.

992
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:51,400
但我只了解到我们有多无知
But all I learned was we know nothing.

993
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:57,940
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

994
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,790
是她自己的选择
She made her choice.

995
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,840
但你为什么不早点告诉我
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

996
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,400
我是想保护你
I was trying to protect you.

997
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,640
我已经失去了你母亲
I lost your mother.

998
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,570
我不想也失去你
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

999
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:24,900
对不起
I'm sorry.

1000
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,460
好棒
This is awesome.

1001
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,240
真的好棒
It's awesome, you know?

1002
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,750
你俩终于解除隔阂  重归于好
You guys are breaking down walls, you're healing.

1003
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,580
这很重要
It's important.

1004
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,520
我把气氛毁了  是不是
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

1005
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:43,140
没错  的确
Yes, you did. Yes.

1006
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,610
我去泡点茶
I'm going to make some tea.

1007
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:52,900
搞定
Nailed it!

1008
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:04,280
好样的  安东蚁
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

1009
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:37,020
你训练的最后阶段是潜入
The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.

1010
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,180
好冷
It's freezing!

1011
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,500
你不能在衣服里加层绒吗
You couldn't make a suit with a flannel lining?

1012
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:44,450
你得拿到这个信号诱饵的原型机
You must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy.

1013
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,080
我当年还在神盾局的时候研发的
It's a device that I invented during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

1014
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,210
我们要用它来干扰
We need it to counteract the transmission blockers

1015
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,390
克洛斯在未来保险库装的通讯拦截器
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

1016
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:54,600
现在正在霍华德·斯塔克的
It's currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark's

1017
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,150
纽约州北边的一个仓库积灰呢
old storage facilities in upstate New York.

1018
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,380
应该是小菜一碟
Should be a piece of cake.

1019
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,910
你在目标区域上空了
You're over the target area.

1020
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,520
现在出发  斯科特
Disengage now, Scott!

1021
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,860
A中队  走
Squadron A, go!

1022
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,310
B队  走
B, go!

1023
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,500
C队  走
C, go!

1024
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:13,180
好了  安东蚁  这次别再把我甩下去了
All right, Ant-thony, please don't drop me this time.

1025
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:16,880
从搬糖块到干这个差距也太大了
Oh, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this!

1026
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,030
保持冷静
Stay calm.

1027
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,170
伙计们  我们可能有麻烦了
Guys? We might have a problem.

1028
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,240
汉克  你不是说是个旧库房吗
Hank, didn't you say this was some old warehouse?

1029
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:27,140
它不是
It's not!

1030
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,770
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

1031
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,060
-斯科特  快回来  -任务中止
- Scott, get out of there. - Abort!

1032
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,190
立刻中止
Abort now!

1033
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,740
没事  看着不像有人在
No, it's okay. It doesn't look like anyone's home.

1034
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:39,980
安东蚁  飞到屋顶去
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

1035
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,370
他要把衣服搞丢了
He's gonna lose the suit.

1036
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:44,040
他命都要丢了
He's gonna lose his life.

1037
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,690
好了  我到目标建筑的屋顶了
All right, I'm on the roof of the target building.

1038
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,550
有人在  斯科特
Somebody's home, Scott.

1039
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:58,990
山姆  下面出什么事了
What's going on down there, Sam?

1040
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:00,240
是猎鹰
It's the Falcon!

1041
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,150
感应器说这里有东西  但我什么都没看到
I had a sensor trip but I'm not seeing anything.

1042
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,490
等等
Wait a second.

1043
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,580
任务中止  斯科特  立刻中止
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

1044
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,250
没事的  他看不到我
It's okay. He can't see me.

1045
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,450
我看得到你
I can see you.

1046
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,590
他看得到我
He can see me.

1047
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,960
你好  我是斯科特
Hi. I'm Scott.

1048
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,530
他刚直接自报家门了吗
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

1049
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,390
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

1050
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:19,840
首先  我是你的粉丝
First off, I'm a big fan.

1051
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,990
谢谢  你谁啊
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

1052
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,660
我是蚁人
I'm Ant-Man.

1053
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,030
"蚁人"吗
"Ant-Man"?

1054
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,480
怎么  没听过我大名吗
What? You haven't heard of me?

1055
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,820
不  你是该没听过我
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

1056
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:30,810
你要说明你是来干什么的吗
You wanna tell me what you want?

1057
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,250
我想过来拿个仪器
I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology.

1058
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,970
借用几天  用完就还
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

1059
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,790
我得拿去拯救世界  你懂的
I need it to save the world. You know how that is.

1060
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,620
我确实懂
I know exactly how that is.

1061
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:41,190
锁定入侵者
Located the breach.

1062
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,010
-马上逮捕他  -对不住了
- Bringing him in. - Sorry about this!

1063
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,160
你他妈在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

1064
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:52,970
入侵者为成年男性
Breach is an adult male,

1065
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:55,020
好像有某种缩小装置
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

1066
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:08,540
抱歉
Sorry!

1067
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,850
听着  我真的很抱歉  对不起
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

1068
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,680
够了
That's enough!

1069
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:36,810
安东蚁  帮下忙
Ant-thony! A little help!

1070
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,810
我看不见你了
I've lost visual.

1071
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,450
他在我的翅膀里
He's inside my pack!

1072
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:02,350
抱歉
Sorry!

1073
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,310
你看起来人很好
You seem like a really great guy.

1074
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:34,250
这事绝对不能被队长知道
It's really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.

1075
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:40,740
你刚那也太不负责而且很危险
That was completely irresponsible and dangerous!

1076
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,940
你威胁到了全盘计划
You jeopardized everything!

1077
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:00,790
你拿到了
You got it.

1078
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,560
干得好
Well done.

1079
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:06,510
等一下
Wait a minute.

1080
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,140
你刚是在表扬我吗
Did you just compliment me?

1081
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,130
他表扬我了  是吧
He did, didn't he?

1082
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,600
听起来是的
Kind of sounded like he did.

1083
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,120
我以前很厉害吧
I was good, wasn't I?

1084
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:18,600
还有我跟一个复仇者干了一架还没死
Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

1085
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,150
别沉溺于往事
Let us not dwell on the past.

1086
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:23,380
还得完成计划
We gotta finish our planning.

1087
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,200
别在意他
Don't mind him.

1088
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:29,260
你做得很好
You did good.

1089
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,450
达伦
Darren.

1090
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,850
你是怎么进来的
How the hell did you get in here?

1091
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,470
前门没锁  汉克
You left the front door open, Hank.

1092
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,130
这回是真的了
It's official.

1093
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,320
你老了
You're old.

1094
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:49,590
计划图纸
The plans.

1095
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:52,720
他会杀了他
He will kill him.

1096
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,780
你有何贵干
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1097
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:01,480
我有好消息
I have good news.

1098
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:02,460
是吗
Really?

1099
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,580
是什么
What's that?

1100
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,390
皮姆科技  你一手建立的公司
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1101
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:11,120
马上要成为世界上
is about to become one of the most

1102
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,850
效益最好的机构了
profitable operations in the world.

1103
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,830
光是明天的买卖就能赚150亿
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales, tomorrow alone.

1104
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:25,440
不用谢了
You're welcome.

1105
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,370
我知道很奇怪  但我想你也在场
I know this is odd, but I'd like you to be there.

1106
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,940
那是我的时刻  我想让你也看到
This is my moment. I want you to see it.

1107
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,590
好的  达伦  可以
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1108
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:38,700
我会到场的
I'll be there.

1109
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,230
你看中我什么了
What did you see in me?

1110
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:59,770
我不懂你什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

1111
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,000
多年以前  你选中了我
All those years ago, you picked me.

1112
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,800
你看到了什么
What did you see?

1113
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,020
我看到了我自己
I saw myself.

1114
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,420
那你为什么又把我推开
Then why did you push me away?

1115
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,820
因为你太像我了
Because I saw too much of myself.

1116
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:29,380
他知道了  那是陷阱
He knows. He's baiting you.

1117
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,940
我们得中止计划
We have to call it off.

1118
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,490
我们都在冒险
We're all taking risks.

1119
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:33,630
要是他看到我在这里怎么办
What if he saw me here?

1120
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:34,910
他没看到的  没有可能
He didn't. There's no way.

1121
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,440
你怎么能确定
How do you know that?

1122
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:40,690
{\an8}{\pos(188,112)}达伦·克洛斯

1123
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,040
达伦  你好
Darren, hi.

1124
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,190
霍普  你现在在哪
Hope, where are you right now?

1125
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,220
我在家  怎么了
I'm at home. Why?

1126
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,500
我刚去见汉克了
I just saw Hank.

1127
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,680
他还是和以前一样轻视我
I still get nothing but contempt from him.

1128
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,210
别跟他生气  他就是个糟老头
Don't let him rile you up. He's just a senile old man.

1129
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,700
所有人都要加班加点的工作
We need to start everyone working around the clock.

1130
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,660
马上准备运行生产线
Get the assembly line up and running.

1131
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,470
我要加强警备
And I'm tripling security.

1132
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:06,410
所有入口都要设感应器
Full sensors at all entrances

1133
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:09,760
通风口都装上钢制微孔筛
and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1134
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,540
好的  好主意
Great. Good idea.

1135
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,680
谢谢你  霍普  有你在我这边真幸运
Thank you, Hope. I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1136
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:22,570
他要加强警备  他已经疯了还盯上你了
He's tripling security. He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1137
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,800
但他没有盯上你
But he is not onto you.

1138
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,290
他要在所有入口加装人体扫描仪
He's adding full body scanners to all entrances

1139
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,240
还要关闭外部通风口
and closing exterior vents.

1140
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,100
斯科特怎么进去
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1141
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:34,040
总水管
The water main.

1142
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,400
你没法加强总水管的安保措施
You can't add security to a water main.

1143
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:39,700
水压太强了  但要是我们能减弱水压
The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it,

1144
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,810
我就能进去
that's how I get in.

1145
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:43,290
得有人在大楼的控制中心
Somebody would have to reach the building's control center

1146
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:44,600
去调节水压
to change the water pressure.

1147
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,020
我和汉克得陪在克洛斯身边
Hank and I will be beside Cross.

1148
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,290
我们根本不可能做到
How are we supposed to do that?

1149
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:49,010
我们要招兵买马了
So we expand our team.

1150
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:50,740
需要哪些人呢
What do we need?

1151
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,580
内部要安插一名假保安
A fake security guard on the inside

1152
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,030
负责进入供水系统降压
to de-pressurize the water system,

1153
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:57,670
另一个人要侵入供电系统切断激光光束
somebody else to hack in to the power supply and kill the laser grid,

1154
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,190
还要一个人接应我们逃跑
and a getaway guy.

1155
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:04,220
不不不  那三个蠢货不行  绝对不行
No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.

1156
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:06,140
谢谢您的咖啡  女士
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1157
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:09,720
很少会有人被打劫了还邀请劫匪坐坐
It's not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back.

1158
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,310
因为我们打劫了你
Because we just robbed you.

1159
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:17,140
你知道他是因为偷了台冰沙机被捕的吧
You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1160
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,280
是两台冰沙机
Two smoothie machines.

1161
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,720
你确定他们能胜任吗
Are you sure they can handle this?

1162
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,410
肯定可以  我们可是专业的
Oh, we can handle it. We're professionals.

1163
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:25,230
请原谅我们对你们没什么信心
You'll forgive us if we're not instilled with confidence.

1164
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,850
各位都先冷静一下  淡定淡定
Well, hey, everybody just kick back and relax a little bit, man.

1165
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,230
我们懂这行
We know our business.

1166
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:31,780
我们可闯入过这老房子  不是吗
We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn't we?

1167
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:32,980
是我放你们进来的
I let you.

1168
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,280
那也可以说是我让你放我进来的
Well, one could say that I let you let me.

1169
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,970
没事  他们能搞定
Look, it's okay. They can handle this.

1170
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:39,860
对  我们能搞定
Yeah, we can handle it.

1171
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,800
-你有他们的证件了吗  -他在系统里了
- You got their credentials? - He's in the system.

1172
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,000
我在系统里了
I'm in the system?

1173
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,450
你在系统里了
You're in the system.

1174
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,660
系统里吗
The system?

1175
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,880
好吧  我们死定了
Yeah, we're doomed.

1176
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,850
好了  有样东西要给你们看看
All right. There's something you guys need to see.

1177
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,710
等你走到这个转角
When you get to this corner,

1178
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,850
你的左侧会有三间办公室
there's gonna be three offices on your left side.

1179
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:56,900
我操
Damn!

1180
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,440
真是太酷炫了  哥们
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1181
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,030
听着  过一会儿会很诡异
Now, look, this is gonna get weird, all right?

1182
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:06,030
会很吓人  但其实没事
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.

1183
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:07,530
不必害怕
There's no reason to be scared.

1184
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,160
不不  老子我天不怕地不怕
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1185
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:10,690
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

1186
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,700
那就好
Good.

1187
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,000
绝对是吉普赛人搞的鬼把戏
This is the work of Gypsies.

1188
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,270
这是巫术吧
That's witchcraft.

1189
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,520
太厉害了
Wow, that's amazing.

1190
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,760
感觉就像大卫·科波菲尔那样
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1191
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,880
这是什么魔法吧
That's some kind of wizardry.

1192
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,000
是巫术
This is sorcery!

1193
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,030
哥们  你是怎么做到的
How'd you do that, bro?

1194
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:31,760
千万别怕  看看你的肩膀
Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.

1195
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,700
滚开  滚开
Get off! Get off!

1196
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,770
你不是还说你天不怕地不怕吗
Wait, I thought Daddy didn't get scared!

1197
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:40,860
我让每人吃了半片镇静剂
I gave them each half a Xanax

1198
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,360
汉克还给他们解释这套衣服的原理呢
and Hank explained the science of the suit to them.

1199
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:44,900
他们就睡着了
They fell right asleep.

1200
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,740
听着  我很感谢你能...
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

1201
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,990
不  别谢我
No, please don't.

1202
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:53,670
我们这么做都是为了大义
We're all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us.

1203
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:54,730
我只是很高兴你还有
I'm just glad that you might have

1204
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:57,400
那么一丝机会可能会成功
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1205
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,850
谢谢你为我打气
Hey, thank you, you know, for that pep talk.

1206
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,800
老实说  我已经从原来的瞧不起你
You know, the honest truth is, I actually went from despising you

1207
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,730
变得快开始喜欢你了
to almost liking you.

1208
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,900
你真的应该去写诗
You really should write poetry.

1209
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,730
去睡会吧  斯科特
Get some sleep, Scott.

1210
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:03,490
好了  确定一下
All right, just so we're clear,

1211
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:05,250
我们都清楚自己的任务了吧
everyone here knows their role, right?

1212
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,870
-戴夫  -负责驾车逃跑
- Dave? - Wheels on the ground.

1213
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:08,370
-科特  -负责搞定监控
- Kurt? - Eyes in the sky.

1214
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:09,840
-路易斯  -你懂的
- Luis? - Oh, man, you know it.

1215
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,330
没错  我要穿制服
You know what? I get to wear a uniform.

1216
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:12,900
-就是这样  -路易斯
- That's what's up. - Luis.

1217
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,230
抱歉  我清楚任务  我只是太兴奋了
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good. I'm just excited.

1218
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:16,390
而且你的女朋友真的很性感
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

1219
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:17,950
看到她我也会特别紧张
So, you know, that makes me nervous, too.

1220
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:19,160
你真的很漂亮  女士
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1221
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:20,710
-我的天哪  -她不是我的...
- Oh, my Lord. - She's not my...

1222
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:22,170
对了  我想到个策略
You know what? I was thinking of a tactic,

1223
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,640
我卧底进去时可以用
like when I go undercover.

1224
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,820
比如吹口哨  你懂我的意思吧  融入进去
Like a whistling. You know what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

1225
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:28,340
不行  别吹口哨  不准吹
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

1226
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,730
这又不是表演才艺节目  不准吹
It's not The Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.

1227
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:49,900
一区一切正常
All clear in Sector One.

1228
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,030
进来
Step out.

1229
01:13:58,980 --> 01:13:59,790
没问题
All clear.

1230
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:06,630
准备就绪
We're set.

1231
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:08,260
祝我好运
Wish me luck.

1232
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,640
设备上线
Utilities online.

1233
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:36,020
你在干什么
Hey! What are you doing?

1234
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:40,840
头儿让我来检查下这  我就来了
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area, so I'm securing it.

1235
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:43,830
我就是头儿
I'm the boss.

1236
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,230
控制室1.3
Utilities 1.3...

1237
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,820
水位正在下降
Water level is dropping!

1238
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,060
爬到抽气管上
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1239
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,910
我看到了
All right, I see it.

1240
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:42,940
拜托了  我得爬上去
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.

1241
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:45,770
没错  没错  就是这样
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

1242
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:51,030
没错  我们做到了  做到了  快点
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1243
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,820
好了  起飞吧  安东蚁
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

1244
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:11,030
蚁人进入大楼了
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1245
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,900
皮姆刚到  时间正好
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1246
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:17,830
外面还有辆福特皇冠
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1247
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,010
有什么问题吗
This is problem?

1248
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:21,370
福特皇冠是卧底警察
Considering the Crown Vic's the most commonly used car

1249
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:23,140
最常开的车
for undercover cops, man,

1250
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,050
没错  出问题了
yes, this is problem.

1251
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,080
是皮姆
That's Pym.

1252
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,640
不
Oh, no.

1253
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,110
我在部署子弹蚂蚁
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

1254
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:36,940
拟猛蚁亚科什么什么蚁
Paraponera clavata de Merna Merna...

1255
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:39,460
不记得学名叫什么  但这人惨了
I don't remember what it's called, but I feel bad for this guy.

1256
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,040
瞧瞧  这还差不多
See? That's what I'm talking about.

1257
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,850
这就是我所说的在严肃的
That's what I call an unfortunate casualty

1258
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,600
行动中不幸的受害者
in a very serious operation.

1259
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,530
信号诱饵就位
Signal decoy in place.

1260
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:11,890
凶巴巴美女也搞定了  斯科特
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1261
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,430
看来皮姆被逮捕了
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1262
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:16,990
斯科特  出问题了
Scott, we have problem.

1263
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,790
问题  什么问题
Problem? What's the problem?

1264
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:22,480
戴夫  戴夫  我们可没这计划
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1265
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:23,410
听我说
Listen to me.

1266
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,560
如果我不进这大楼  有人就会死
If I don't get into this building, people will die.

1267
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,320
有那么夸张吗
That's awfully dramatic.

1268
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,330
是不是在逗我
Are you kidding me?

1269
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,260
问题解决了
Problem solved.

1270
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,540
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

1271
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:10,810
终于来了
There he is.

1272
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,780
刚刚好  走吧
Just in time. Come on.

1273
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,540
十二项验证
12-point verification.

1274
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,710
有点过头了  你不觉得吗  达伦
Little over-the-top, don't you think, Darren?

1275
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:29,950
正在确认授权
Confirming authorization level.

1276
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,770
防范于未然嘛
Well, you can never be too safe.

1277
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,610
准许进入
Access granted.

1278
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,700
得为你鼓鼓掌  达伦
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

1279
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,340
你真的做到了
You really did it.

1280
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,450
这还只是一部分  汉克
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1281
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,420
前往第二目标位置
Arriving in second position.

1282
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,910
全速前进  安东蚁  冲吧
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!

1283
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:31,030
继续向指定位置前进
Proceeding to command position.

1284
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,790
我马上就回来  安东蚁
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

1285
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:53,870
好了  各位  我到了
All right, guys. I'm in position.

1286
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:55,740
我要给蚂蚁们发指令了
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1287
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:57,370
不不不
No, no, no, no, no!

1288
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,510
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

1289
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:08,280
各就各位
Assume formation.

1290
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:10,530
好了  你们这些可爱的小家伙
All right, you cute little crazies,

1291
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:12,300
烧坏这些服务器吧
let's fry these servers!

1292
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:26,430
上吧兄弟们
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1293
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,550
服务器已被毁坏
Servers are fried.

1294
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:42,610
备份数据均已被擦除
Data backup completely erased.

1295
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:44,300
正在前往粒子实验室
Heading to the particle chamber.

1296
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:52,690
你好  克洛斯博士
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1297
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:59,160
我的伙伴们答应了你的条件
My associates have agreed to your terms.

1298
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,230
太好了
Wonderful.

1299
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,720
卡森先生向这几位先生引荐了我
Mr. Carson introduced me to these fine gentlemen here.

1300
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,710
他们是九头蛇的代表们
They're representatives of Hydra.

1301
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:06,200
他们不是曾经那样了
They're not what they were.

1302
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,880
他们正在进行有趣的工作
They're doing some interesting work.

1303
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,110
而我也很享受这样
And I'm enjoying myself.

1304
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:14,000
你一直把技术藏起来不给我
You tried to hide your technology from me.

1305
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,650
现在你自食恶果了吧
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

1306
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:25,070
我早就预料到你会出拳揍我
I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away,

1307
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:27,460
可我还以为这一拳会很软弱无力呢
but I just figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.

1308
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,110
那你想错了
Well, you figured wrong.

1309
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:31,370
我见过这辆车
I know this van.

1310
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,190
有人吗
Anybody home?

1311
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,980
好了各位  我到了
All right, guys. I'm here.

1312
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,350
正在安装炸弹
I'm setting the charges.

1313
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,120
各位干得很好  接下来交给我吧
Great job, guys. I'll take it from here.

1314
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:19,930
安东蚁  辛苦了
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1315
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:23,230
最后目标位
Final position.

1316
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,870
各位  激光光栅关了吗
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

1317
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:35,500
-快了  -并没搞定
- Almost. - No, you're not.

1318
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,630
-马上就好了  -并没有
- I'm getting close! - No, you're not.

1319
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,340
旧金山警察局
San Francisco P.D.!

1320
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:44,680
从车里出来
Out of the van!

1321
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:46,150
我知道你们在里面
I know you're in there!

1322
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:46,930
再快点
Make it go faster.

1323
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:48,760
哥们  别再催我了
Dude, seriously.

1324
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,230
准备跃入  听到没  科特
Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?

1325
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,910
马上就好
So close.

1326
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:59,410
-等等  再等一会  -别动
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute! - Freeze!

1327
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:00,940
有个和我长得一模一样的黑人
There was a black guy that looked exactly like me

1328
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:03,150
袭击了我们  把我们关进这破车里
who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.

1329
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,810
-给我出来  -我这不是在出来嘛
- Get out of the van! - Okay, I'm coming.

1330
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:05,940
别紧张
Take it easy!

1331
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,300
我不走  快上
No, I will not move! Go now!

1332
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:11,320
等等
Wait!

1333
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,080
什么  为什么又要等等
What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1334
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:24,570
搞什么
What? What?

1335
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:27,230
小家伙
Hey, little guy.

1336
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:43,040
我一直都怀疑你还偷藏了一套衣服
I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere.

1337
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,280
那么问题来了
Which begs the question,

1338
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,560
这位新蚁人是谁
who is the new Ant-Man?

1339
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:50,490
这位让我敬爱的导师更加信任的人是谁
Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me?

1340
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:55,430
斯科特·朗
Scott Lang.

1341
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:58,160
殉道者
A martyr

1342
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,780
反抗了社会也付出了代价
who took on the system and paid the price,

1343
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:04,850
失去了他的家庭和他唯一的女儿
losing his family and his only daughter in the process.

1344
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:07,650
正好是你的口味  汉克
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1345
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:14,350
他越了狱  没有留下任何线索
He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how.

1346
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:18,040
然后神奇地消失了
And then he disappears magically,

1347
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,960
虽然身上一分钱都没有
despite having no money to his name.

1348
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,370
现在他把蚁人服带来了
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1349
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:30,090
唯一能与我的发明相提并论的设计
The only thing that can rival my creation.

1350
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:33,200
达伦  别这么做
Darren, don't do this.

1351
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,540
如果你把它卖给这些人
If you sell to these men,

1352
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:37,130
一定会引发世界混乱
it's gonna be chaos.

1353
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,610
我已经卖了
I already have.

1354
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:40,070
而且多亏了你
And for twice the price,

1355
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:41,170
卖了两倍的价格
thanks to you.

1356
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,490
要成功侵入复联大楼可不容易
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility.

1357
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:48,100
庆幸的是  消息传千里
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1358
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,420
我会把黄衫卖给他们
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,

1359
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:52,060
不过粒子我就自己留着了
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1360
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:54,080
这可不烧柴油
They don't run on diesel.

1361
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,600
如果想要燃料  就得来找我
If you want the fuel, you'll have to come to me.

1362
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,940
你会怎么称呼全世界
What do you call the only man

1363
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:03,600
唯一一位手握最强大武器的人
who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?

1364
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,620
世界上最强大的人
The most powerful man in the world.

1365
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:07,760
你为我感到自豪了吗
You proud of me yet?

1366
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,140
现在收手还来得及  达伦
You can stop this, Darren. It's not too late.

1367
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:13,930
早已经来不及了
It's been too late for a long time now.

1368
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:16,500
达伦
Darren!

1369
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,060
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1370
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:23,320
他照顾不好你  就像你也照顾不好我
He wasn't any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.

1371
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,100
这不是原来的你
This is not who you are.

1372
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,190
你的大脑化学物质被粒子改变了
It's the particles altering your brain chemistry.

1373
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:38,090
等等  等等
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1374
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:43,150
你说得对  必须我亲自动手
You're right. I have to be the one to do it.

1375
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:46,600
好戏来了
Here we go.

1376
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,280
把  枪  放  下
Drop your gun.

1377
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,500
那天晚上我去他家本来是想杀他
You know, I came to the house the other night to kill him,

1378
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,120
可你当时也在

因为你会不断缩小
as you shrink for all eternity...

1519
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:08,930
你所知
Everything that you know

1520
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:12,690
和所爱的一切
and love,

1521
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:15,490
都将一去不复返
gone forever.

1522
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:18,730
爸爸  你在哪里
Daddy, where are you?

1523
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:38,300
你在哪里
Where are you?

1524
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:42,050
你在哪里啊
Where are you?

1525
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,180
-爸爸  -凯西
- Daddy! - Cassie.

1526
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:54,460
爸爸  回来
Come back, Daddy!

1527
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:01,450
不要乱动调节器
Do not screw with the regulator!

1528
01:42:31,620 --> 01:42:33,320
爸爸
Daddy!

1529
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,380
我好爱你
I love you so much.

1530
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:40,000
我也爱你
I love you, too.

1531
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:41,860
很爱很爱
So much.

1532
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:48,290
房顶上有个大洞
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

1533
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:52,040
抱歉
Sorry.

1534
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,070
-她没事吧  -嗯  她没事
- Is she all right? - Yeah, she's fine.

1535
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:00,100
妈妈
Mommy!

1536
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,030
她没事  她没事
She's fine, she's fine.

1537
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:15,360
拜托  斯科特
Scott, please.

1538
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,090
你什么都不记得了吗
You don't remember anything?

1539
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:19,860
汉克  我记不得了
Hank. I don't.

1540
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,520
肯定还有些什么的
There must be something else.

1541
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:25,910
好吧  我觉得人类的大脑
Well, I suppose the human mind

1542
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:29,460
是没法理解这种经历的
just can't comprehend the experience,

1543
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:32,780
但你却成功了
but you made it.

1544
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:34,640
你进去以后
You went in,

1545
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,140
又出来了
and you got out.

1546
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,760
真棒
It's amazing.

1547
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:43,690
斯科特
Scott,

1548
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:45,730
我带你出去
I'll walk you out.

1549
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:51,700
好好休息
Get some rest.

1550
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:01,860
这真的有可能吗
Is it possible?

1551
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,330
什么时候的事
When did this happen?

1552
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:22,740
没什么事
Nothing's happening.

1553
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:25,180
等等  算是有点什么事吧
Whoa. Hold on. Something's kind of happening.

1554
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:27,240
要真是这样
Well, if that's the case,

1555
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:28,530
再给我来一枪
shoot me again.

1556
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,290
我不知道你刚在干嘛
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,

1557
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:31,630
对我又抱又亲的
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1558
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:33,560
我也有点小惊讶呢
I'm a little surprised myself.

1559
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:36,290
我得去个地方  一会见  汉克
I have to get somewhere. I'll see you later, Hank.

1560
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:37,320
霍普  你真是的
Really, Hope.

1561
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:39,410
斯科特
Scott.

1562
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:42,270
-满嘴胡话  -没错
- You're full of shit. - Oh, yeah.

1563
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:45,330
斯科特  我今天见了我们警监
Scott, I met with my captain today.

1564
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:47,900
他想要你出狱那晚的报告
He wanted a report on the night that you got out of jail.

1565
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,480
摄像头出现了故障
Something happened with the cameras.

1566
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:53,270
一些电路被烧坏了
Some circuits got fried.

1567
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:56,770
但我跟他说你是走正规程序出去的
But I told him that you were processed correctly.

1568
01:44:57,020 --> 01:44:57,890
真的吗
Really?

1569
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,160
是的
Well, yeah.

1570
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:04,410
不能因为电子故障就把凯西的爸爸送回监狱  对吧
Can't be sending Cassie's dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1571
01:45:04,410 --> 01:45:05,560
谢谢你  帕克斯顿
Thank you, Paxton.

1572
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:07,220
我太感动了
I'm blown away.

1573
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:10,310
谢谢你为凯西所做的一切
Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.

1574
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:12,730
不甚荣幸
Well, that's my pleasure.

1575
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:16,360
不过这次  我是为了你
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1576
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:19,890
好尴尬
This is awkward.

1577
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:21,390
-没错  -没错
- Yeah.  - Yeah.

1578
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:23,930
这事之后我们还有什么可谈的呢
I mean, what do we even talk about after all of that?

1579
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:25,290
-我知道  -什么
- Oh, I know. - What?

1580
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:27,190
我今天第一次横翻筋斗
I did my first cartwheel today.

1581
01:45:27,190 --> 01:45:27,930
什么
What?

1582
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:30,330
没错  她练了一个星期了
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

1583
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:31,180
今天真是见证奇迹的时刻
But today was the magic day.

1584
01:45:31,190 --> 01:45:33,910
我用手机录下来了  看
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1585
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:37,240
不  这不可能是凯西  这不是你
No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.

1586
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:38,190
是她
Yeah, it is.

1587
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:40,820
这分明是专业体操运动员  不可能是你
This is a professional gymnast. There is no way that's you.

1588
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:42,220
的确就是她
Yeah, that's her.

1589
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,850
好狗狗
Good boy.

1590
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:49,030
亲爱的  真的太棒了
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1591
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:53,010
抱歉
Sorry.

1592
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,790
工作上的事
It's work.

1593
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:01,320
好的
All right.

1594
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,080
这样吧  把事实告诉我
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1595
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,710
讲重点  只讲重点
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1596
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:08,180
呼气  专注  简简单单
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1597
01:46:08,190 --> 01:46:10,170
行  行  没问题的
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1598
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:12,740
我和我表哥伊格纳西奥去艺术馆
So, I'm at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1599
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:14,800
是一个抽象表现主义的展览
And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit.

1600
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,090
但你知道的  我比较喜欢新立体主义的作品
But you know me, I'm more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1601
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:20,130
但有个人叫罗斯科的人非常棒  天呐
But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1602
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:21,260
路易斯
Luis.

1603
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:22,350
好了  抱歉  抱歉
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1604
01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:24,500
我就是太兴奋了
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1605
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:26,290
但不管怎么说  伊格纳西奥告诉我
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1606
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:27,920
"我昨晚在焦点酒吧
"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick

1607
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,970
遇到一个超正点的作家妹子  超级正点
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.

1608
01:46:29,970 --> 01:46:31,520
特别特别正点  然后他
Like crazy-stupid fine." And he

1609
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,640
过去跟酒保说
goes up to the bartender and goes,

1610
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,190
看那个和我一起的妹子  懂我意思不
"Look at the girl I'm with. You know what I'm sayin'?

1611
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:35,280
她超正的  对吧
"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1612
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,430
酒保说  是啊  的确超正
The bartender's all like, "Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1613
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:40,440
所以这个作家妹子告诉伊格纳西奥
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,

1614
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:43,280
我可是小道八卦界女王
"Yo, I'm like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1615
01:46:43,290 --> 01:46:45,260
我和幕后大佬关系可好了
"And I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains,

1616
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:46,020
你懂我说得不
"You know what I'm saying?"

1617
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:47,590
伊格纳西奥就问  真的呀
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1618
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:49,180
她说  真的啊
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,

1619
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:50,450
我不能告诉你我线人是谁
I can't tell you who my contact is,

1620
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:52,300
因为他和复联一起工作
"Because he works with the Avengers."

1621
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:53,500
天呐
Oh, no.

1622
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:56,100
这人听上去很厉害呢
Yeah, and this dude sounds like a badass, man.

1623
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,220
他走过去跟她说
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1624
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:59,100
"我在找个超级英雄界的新人
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude who's new on the scene,

1625
01:46:59,110 --> 01:47:00,560
"刚初来乍到
"who's flashing his fresh tack,

1626
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,140
"技能出众的人  你知道谁吗"
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got?"

1627
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,240
她说  什么人都有啊
And she's like, "Well, we got everything nowaday.

1628
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:06,360
有会蹦的
We got a guy who jumps.

1629
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:08,760
会飞的  还有爬墙的
"We got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1630
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,820
你得说具体点
"You gotta be more specific."

1631
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:12,220
他说  我要找个能缩小的
And he's like, "I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1632
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,130
我说  靠  我很紧张
And I'm, like, "Damn!". I got all nervous

1633
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:15,790
因为我要为你保守秘密
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1634
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:16,890
所以我问伊格纳西奥
So I asked Ignacio,

1635
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:19,050
"那个狠角色是不是让超正作家找你
"Did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick

1636
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:21,430
让你来找我  因为我和他要找的
to tell you to tell me, because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1637
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:22,730
那个蚁人关系很好吗
"That he's looking for him?"

1638
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:25,820
然后呢  他说什么
And? What'd he say?

1639
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,670
他说  没错
He said, "Yes."

1640
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:41,130
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,224)}蚁  人

1641
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:41,170
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,188)}蚁  人

1645
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:41,340

{\an8}蚁  人

1652
01:49:25,970 --> 01:49:27,660
我想给你看个东西
There's something I want to show you.

1653
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:33,700
力量是无法摧毁的
I realized you can't destroy power.

这个升级版原型衣
This is an advanced prototype

1656
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:50,720
是我和你母亲一同研发的
that your mother and I worked on together.

1657
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,330
她都没有机会用
She never got to use it.

1658
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:00,140
但我现在明白了  这是我们为你造的
But now I realize that we were... We were working on it for you.

是时候完成这件衣服了

是时候了

一周前做这件事肯定更容易
This would have been a lot easier a week ago.

-如果我给托尼打电话  -他不会相信我们的
- If we call Tony... - He won't believe us.

1665
01:56:38,730 --> 01:56:39,610
就算他相信
Even if he did...

1666
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:41,910
协议应该不准他帮忙吧
Who knows if the Accords will let him help.

1667
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:44,300
我们现在只能靠自己了
We're on our own.

1668
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:47,040
或许不用
Maybe not.

1669
01:56:49,690 --> 01:56:50,820
